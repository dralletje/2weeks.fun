I eventually need some kind of Entity-Component-System.

  Javascript ECS, but uses strings as identifiers for components?
- https://excaliburjs.com/docs/entity-component-system/
  Another javascript one (bundled with excalibur.js).
  Also has a special "World" type that I might want to take a look at.
- https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/entity-component-system.html
  Another JS one, don't feel like I want to use code from this one but the concepts are solid.

  Rust ECS that does not have an `update()` step

  Turns out Minecraft Bedrock uses an ECS, but java doesn't...
